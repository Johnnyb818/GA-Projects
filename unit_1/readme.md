My initial approach, I wanted to create a simple pokedex using a form input to be able to look up the pokemon the user wanted and would pull from the Pokeapi.co using an AJAX call and display some basic stats and an image about that individual pokemon. Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery to create the site. Using the form tag and Jquery I was able to pull from the Pokeapi simply and display the stats of my choosing on the page. I then went a step further to learn how to make a modal and in doing so found out you could create a polaroid, I thought it would be fun to display the image inside of that. The modal was a fun challenge, along with CSS styling in general. For my last little stretch I added a signature at the bottom of the picture so you can have your favorite pokemon sign it. This was a great learing experience the whole way through! Please check it out and let me know what you think! Thank you!
